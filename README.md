# Movie Seat Booking

## Introduction

Movie Seat Booking is an interactive web application designed to simulate the experience of selecting and booking seats at a movie theater. This project allows users to choose from a selection of movies, view available seating, select seats, and complete their purchase, all with the convenience of a responsive design suitable for any device. Occupied seats are clearly marked, preventing selection, and users' choices are saved to local storage, ensuring their selections persist even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Display UI**: Showcases movie selections, a screen representation, seating arrangement, a legend for seat status, and pricing information.
- **Movie and Seat Selection**: Users can choose a movie and select or deselect seats according to their preference.
- **Occupied Seats Handling**: Occupied seats are clearly marked and cannot be selected by the user, ensuring a realistic booking experience.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The number of selected seats and the total price are displayed and updated in real-time as the user makes their selections.
- **Persistence**: Selected seats, chosen movie, and the total price are saved to local storage, so the user's choices are retained across page refreshes.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on both large screens and smaller devices. On smaller devices, the center of the view is optimized for the middle of the cinema.

## How to Use

1. **Select a Movie**: Start by choosing a movie from the dropdown menu at the top of the page. Prices vary by movie.
2. **Choose Your Seats**: Click on any available seat (not marked as occupied) to select it. Click again to deselect. Your total price will update accordingly.
3. **Complete Your Booking**: Once you've selected your seats, the total price for your selection is displayed. Your choices are automatically saved to local storage.
